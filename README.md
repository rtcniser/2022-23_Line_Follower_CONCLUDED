# Line-Follower
Autonomous Line follower, started as a part of [SDP 2.0](https://www.niser.ac.in/~smishra/club/rtc/skill-development-program/) in an attempt for competitions.  
***1st Runners-up*** in Line Follower, [NIRMAN 2.0](https://www.nirmansilicon.tech/), Silicon Institute, Bhubaneswar.  
***Winners*** in Trekkon(Line follower), [WISSENAIRE-23](https://www.wissenaire.org/), Indian Institute of Technology, Bhubaneswar.

# Working Idea
# Code (Arduino)
Written on Arduino. There are two version: 
- Casewise/Conditional high-lows (_Used in NIRMAN-2.0_)  
    Codes: v0 and v3   
- PID (_Used in Wissenaire-23_)  
    Codes: v20,v21,v22,v32,v4
    v4 being the latest.  
    _Note_  that v4 code has an `speed(255,255)` in `//sharp left` case. This was a deliberate change to account for the multiple left turns in the track. This also helped in escaping a right loop, significantly reducing lap time.
# Circuit
Generic Design for motors with 5 sensors to arduino.
### Wirings
# Chassis 
### Design
- 17cm (height) X 14cm (width) body.
- Front panel to stick IR sensors
- Cover panel to sandwich and hold the motors.

Since the cut was made on 5mm acrylic, the front panel was not required in the final setup. _Note_ that using the front panel keeps all the sensors one line, as in a generic setup. _Otherwise_ it stays in an inverted V shape which can give some strategical advantage (like detecting crosses better).
### Irregularities/Errors 
The top screw holes might be a bit off.
